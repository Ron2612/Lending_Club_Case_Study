## General Information
- The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
- The dataset contains the complete loan data for all the loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Majority of the columns given in the dataset are of no use for the business problem I am trying to solve.
- The column grade plays an important role in predicting the type of loan_status.
- The column emp_length tells us about the pattern of the loan appliers.
- Maximum number of loan applicants are the ones that apply loan of 5000 at an interest rate of 7.5%
